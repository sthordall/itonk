DNS fundamentals
	1. In Linux, run the commands hostname and nm-tool and investigate the output. In Windows, run the command ipconfig /all and investigate the output.
		- nm-tool output: What does the Address field tell us?
 		- nm-tool output: What does the Prefix field tell us? 
 		- nm-tool output: What does the Gateway field tell us? 
 		- nm-tool output: What does the DNS fields tell us?
	2. In Linux or Windows, ping a webserver
		- Try browsing the net by IP number and name using your browsers address field
	3. Host Lookup Table (HLT)
		- Edit your HLT and redirect the name of a web server to IP address of another 
		- Is the HLT looked through before your primary DNS server is queried?
		- Who first proposed the HLT?
		- When was the HLT proposed?
	4. What does TLD stand for?
	5. Why does a FQDN end with a dot, “.”?
	6. What is a DNS "A" record and what is it used for?
	7. What is a DNS zone and what it is used for?
Name resolution
	1. What is recursive and iterative name resolution?
	2. How may DNS caching be more effective in recursive vs. iterative resolution?
	3. Why are client-side communication costs reduced in recursive name resolution?
	4. Why does recursive resolution put higher performance demands on each name server?
DNS security extensions
	1. What is DNSSEC and why is it needed?
	2. What is a signed zone?
	3. What common types of security vulnerabilities are hindered by DNSSEC?
BIND DNS server
	1. Install BIND on a Linux machine and check the installation
	2. Configure a caching name server and forwarder
	3. Use Google’s Name Bench to find a suitable public DNS server to forward to 
	4. Test and document that forwarding works as intended
	5. Test and document whether the DNS lookup time is reduced by caching
Prototype
	- Consider a concrete case, e.g. home, school, office, or hospital, where employing a caching name server and forwarder serves a realistic purpose
	- How would you set up BIND in your case?
	- What functionalities in BIND would you use?

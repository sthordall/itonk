Leader Election
  --- Stephan ---
  1. Why is leader election relevant in distributed systems?
  2. Does leader election entail a computational, network, and time burden?
     - Why is it relevant to minimize a potential burden?
     - How is the big O notation wrt. message passing a measure of such a      burden?

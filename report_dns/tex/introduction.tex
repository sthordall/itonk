\chapter{Introduction}

The report is about the Domain Name System (DNS). In the report the following subjects will be touched:

\begin{itemize}
\item DNS fundamentals
\item DNS name resolution
\item DNS security extensions
\item BIND DNS server
\end{itemize}

The relevance of this report is justified by showing some of the fundamentals regarding the DNS.
The DNS plays its role by supporting the internet infrastructure and by providing a distributed and fairly robust mechanism that resolves host names into IP addresses and IP addresses back into host names. It will also provide decent demonstrations of touching DNS elements throughout the report.

The structure of the report follows the above list of subjects. In the end of the report, a prototype by the group will be presented followed by a discussion and conclusion of the DNS project.

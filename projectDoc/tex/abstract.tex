About your reports and this template
\begin{itemize}
\item Use this template for your project reports
\item Substitute the [place-holders] with your text. Do not keep the square brackets
\item You are free to add chapters and sections
\item Hand in the reports as pdf files - one pdf per report.
\item The report should be around 15 pages in total and it must be
  written in English
\end{itemize}

Why \LaTeX?
\begin{itemize}
\item I want you to try Latex as this is a very powerful and widely
  used document preparation system that is de facto standard in,
  e.g. mathematics, physics, computer science and engineering.
\end{itemize}

About the abstract, i.e. the current section
\begin{itemize}
\item An abstract is a brief summary of the report that helps the
  reader quickly ascertain the report's purpose. The abstract should
  be approximately half a page.
\end{itemize}
